#AntennaRange Relays

Ever wanted to get money for setting up AntennaRange network relays?  Your dreams can come true with the **AntennaRange Relays** contract pack!

##Features / Parts / Gallery

**AntennaRange Relays** is a contract pack for Contract Configurator which gives you up to one (1) contract for each body in the solar system (besides the homeworld, of course).  The contract is to send a satellite with an appropriate dish into an orbit low enough that surface missions can use the whip antenna instead of having to pack a big dish (so long as a relay is overhead, of course).  Missions to your homeworld's moons or the inner planets (Duna/Mars) are required to use a DTS-M1, while missions to outer planets or moons get the Communotron 88-88.  You also have to have your tracking station upgraded to the appropriate level.

The contracts are generated based on the lists of planets and moons in your solar system, so you can install Outer Planets or Real Solar System or whatever you want, and the contracts will automatically adjust themselves accordingly.

##Dependencies

* AntennaRange Relays depends on [Contract Configurator](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/101604-1-0-2-Contract-Configurator-v1-0-4-2015-05-08), version 1.2.2 or later.

##Recommended addons

* Although it's not strictly necessary for the contracts to work, there wouldn't be much point in doing these missions without [AntennaRange](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/56440-1-0-AntennaRange-1-8-Enforce-and-Encourage-Antenna-Diversity).
